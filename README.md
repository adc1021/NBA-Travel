# NBA Travel

### Introduction
Each year, teams in professional sports see scores of athletes suffer injuries both minor and major. After creating a predictive model to try and determine the leading causes of injuries in the NBA, I was fascinated by the effect travel schedules may have on player health. In this Tableau visualization, I display the key differences in travel between the bottom and top 5 teams in the league, in regards to overall travel schedule. 

The questions I wanted to address were as follows: 
1. Do coastal teams have more difficult travel schedules?
2. Does geography and travel play any role in team outcomes, based on record?
3. As my predictive model suggests, does the total amount of miles travelled per team affect the number of injuries a team suffers?
